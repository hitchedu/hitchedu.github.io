      CSS provides so many options that it is actually difficult to decide what to apply! I feel like this is going to be an organic growth in knowledge as I get more experience through use and observation. The most frustrating part of updating CSS is that it seems to take significantly longer to apply than when I was only using HTML. This may have just been due to the timing of my updates, or because I was making larger swaths of edits instead of frequent incremental ones. Either way, I had the bright idea of editing the page directly through Inspect Element, which allowed me to see instant feedback on my edits. Then when I was comfortable with the changes, I would add them to my actual HTML or CSS files. The addition of CSS also showed me empty paragraph tags I had left behind, so that was a reminder to always check the results of edits to my code, and never assume that it did not make any unexpected changes or reveals!
