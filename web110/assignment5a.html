    <h1>Assignment 5a - Summary</h1>
    <p>For my first Activity in this assignment, I chose GCFLearnFree: LinkedIn Basics. While I do already have a LinkedIn profile, my knowledge of how to utilize the site to my benefit is woefully inadequate. I learned about Recommendations and Endorsements, both of which can be added to your profile by your Connections (what most other social media sites would call Friends). As the LinkedIn profile can serve as sort of an extended resume, I will be working on expanding the amount of information I have entered for my profile in order to assist in my future connections and job searches.

    <p>For my second Activity in this assignment, I chose GCFLearnFree: Blog Basics. I believe I attempted to start a blog at some point many years ago, but now I donâ€™t even remember where it was hosted or what it was going to be about. The information about RSS readers is what really drew me to focus on this activity, as I now understand my absolutely most favorite (and no longer working) Chrome extension to be a glorified RSS reader for YouTube videos, and the podcast app I have on my phone is also technically an RSS reader for audio files! While I do not have an interest in writing my own blog right now, I am starting to use an internal work feature very simply named Journals in order to keep extemporaneous notes that are visible to my Team Lead and Manager. Some of the recommendations about subject and schedule will really help me keep a focus on my work Journals.
