    <h1>Assignment 5b - Summary</h1>
    <p>While focusing exclusively on music, the RIAA:About Piracy module regarding Intellectual Property can be easily applied to anything that has a copyright. In this digital age of instant access, free streaming, and unlimited access to a curated list of games via subscription, it honestly seems to strange to not be able to summon something with your fingertips on your phone, tablet, computer, or console. But not everything is available, and much of what is available is not accessible for free. While the law is airtight, it sometimes feels like it just doesn’t make sense to not be allowed to copy digital files from someone else. From IT employees to pastors, I’ve heard justification upon justification. I’ve even participated in those activities in the past, but find myself less able to feel like they are justifiable as I mature. But no matter how I personally feel on the subject of pirating copyrighted products, it’s not worth getting in trouble for.
