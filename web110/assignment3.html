    <h1>Assignment 3 - Summary</h1>
    <p>For my first activity this week, I chose the “Use search engines” section. I had already learned at some point in the past about using quotation marks to force an exact phrase search, and I have discovered the Advanced Search on my own. But forcing results to be from a specific site and excluding words from the results was actually new to me. And using Booleans was something I was vaguely aware of, but never really learned how to use. I messed around with all of that a little bit, but can’t really think of a time in which I would have benefited greatly from these more specific search functions. The article titled “Evaluating Internet Resources” was extremely interesting to me, as determining the veracity and trustworthiness of information has always been a high priority of mine. I may have spent too much time in the past 20 years arguing on the internet, but I have always attempted to utilize credible sources. But even with my hands-on history, many of the points in this article were simply a gut feeling before that I now have a specific list to reference for. Which will be easy for me to do so, since I have now bookmarked it.

    <p>Artificial Intelligence is what I chose for my second activity, as it is both intriguing and frightening, depending on how you think about it. The goal described for AI in one of the linked videos is basically that “AI should be human, and more”. But at its base level, AI is still a program. Sure, it can generate responses and art, but can it generate anything truly unique? In a sense, yes. But the caveat is that the AI is learning what people like and accept, compares its random generations to those pieces of data, and displays the ones that will get upvotes and a Thank You. AI does not truly have the passion to create art or write a poem. It recreates what people like about passionate art and poetry. I can trust my GPS to be correct 99.9% of the time because care has been taken to ensure that it has been fed accurate data an overwhelming percentage of the time. I’ve seen just a fraction of a percent of what is on the internet, and unless AI is being fed only personally curated data, AI answers are less trustworthy than my GPS. And also, if we need to curate the data taught to AI, then we need to be careful about who specifically is curating that data. And at that point, would we be sacrificing free speech for progress? What a quandary… All that said, I do look forward to utilizing versions of AI for limited aspects of my digital life. Trying to figure out something difficult in a game and can’t find the right information in a wiki or guide? And AI that has been trained on that data could answer your questions much faster than you could struggle to find it yourself. And if it is giving you information from a trusted guide, then you know the data is good! But video games are a far cry from legal arguments and governmental policy.
