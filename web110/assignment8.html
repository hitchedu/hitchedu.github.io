    <h1>Assignment 8 - Summary</h1>
    <p>This lesson was very enjoyable to me, as I really do love attempting to get the code to do exactly what I want it to do, while also keeping it tidy. Of course, I had to edit so many times due to mistakes. Some of them were only visual within the code itself, and some of them were actual errors like not correctly tagging a line as a comment. Well, there we go, waiting another 30 seconds for the Commit to take! While I do have a fair amount of patience, especially when I know that I understand the objective and how to do it, waiting for another edit to get pushed is teaching me to slow down just a little bit more to check for corrections. I look forward to using both the concepts I have learned about coding and the HTML instructions specifically in the future, for personal and work activities. My ideas are brimming over so quickly that I think I need to create a list of them, possibly in GitHub!
