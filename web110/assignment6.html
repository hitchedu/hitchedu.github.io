    <h1>Assignment 6 - Summary</h1>
    <p>The first activity I did was using ipconfig, tracert, and nslookup. I will not pretend to yet have a full understanding of the output of all of those commands, but it feels like I’m on Mr. Robot or I’m a hacker in some movie; being able to type in a command and get lines upon lines of data that all deal with the physical points that the digital traffic is passing through. Seeing the hop time in milliseconds is also quite an eye-opener! Obviously, we know that data gets to us fast when looking something up on the internet. But seeing how fast it actually is from one point to the next is amazing.

    <p>I’ve always wanted to set up a home server, but never got to the point of actually figuring out what I needed, how much it would cost, how to set it up, and how to use it. So yeah, it was just a dream. But while this lesson doesn’t get into the server side of it, this is pushing me to understand how everything would be connected to the internet! I have always just had Comcast’s router/modem, and never branched out with my own setup. I now see that the Router and Modem are actually separate devices, which apparently can be combined into a single housing for simplicity’s sake. The Modem is where it all begins, as that is the device that is connected directly to the cables containing your house’s access to the internet. From there, the Router is what manages connections and data flow from the Modem to the internet-connected devices within its range. In order for a device to receive the signal from the Router, it either needs to be plugged in physically with an Ethernet Cable running from the Router to the device’s Wired Network Adapter, or it needs to have a Wireless Network Adapter that is connected to the Router wirelessly. While I don’t currently need a Network Switch, it is possible that I would need one once I am setting up my home server. This would allow additional wired connections to the Router, both freeing up space in the wireless traffic inside the house, and allowing a faster connection to the wired devices (compared to instead being connected wirelessly). While I don’t know the specs well enough to understand what caliber of each of these devices would actually benefit me, it looks like I could put together a setup that would service my current needs for under $150. Once building a home server, these would likely be closer to at least $250. And that doesn’t include any of the server cost itself.
