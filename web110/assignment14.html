    <h1>Assignment 14 - Summary</h1>
    <p>SQL SELECT Statement</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SELECT * FROM Customers;</li>
        </ul>
    <p>SQL Where Clause</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SELECT * FROM Customers<br>
            WHERE Country='USA';</li>
        </ul>
    <p>SQL COUNT function</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SELECT COUNT(ProductID)<br>
            FROM Products;</li>
        </ul>
    <p>INSERT INTO Statement</p>
        <ul>
            <li>INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)<br>
            VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');</li>
        </ul>
    <p>UPDATE Statement</p>
        <ul>
            <li>UPDATE Customers<br>
            SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'<br>
            WHERE CustomerID = 1;</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        While I am not allowed to use INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements at work yet, the SELECT WHERE statements are of course all over the queries that I use at my job. 
        I also see a fair number of SELECT FROM and JOIN, as well as UNION here and there. Every time I need to use one of the queries I look up how each of the operators 
        works and attempt to determine what sort of information I will be provided and where it would have been taken from. I have not yet determined if I am able to view 
        the database itself yet, so I have no way of knowing whether my guesses are correct, but it is good mental practice to keep me in a learning mindset regarding SQL 
        and what it can do.
