    <p>This lesson was a bit more difficult for me, as I had ideas of what I wanted the page to look like, but struggled to find the correct code to make it happen. My attempts at centering the elements were thwarted by my searches leading me to options that are no longer supported, but I eventually got around that one. However, auto-sizing the .svg is something I never ended up figuring out, and I am turning in the assignment with just the centering instead. While searching for ways to make the code create the look I wanted, I discovered that there are usually multiple options to get the job done. The question is simply how you want to go about it. Sometimes you can add inline style, and sometimes it is better to resort to tagging an element specifically to be manipulated from elsewhere. Being familiar with these options will help in the future with both initial creation and troubleshooting.
