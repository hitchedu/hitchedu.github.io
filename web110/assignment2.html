    <h1>Assignment 2 - Summary</h1>
    <p>For the first activity, I decided to complete the GCFLearnFree: Chrome tutorial. Chrome is likely the browser I have chosen to use the most over my years of multiple personal computers, as well as work and publicly available computers (like the public library), so I wanted to see how much I already knew, and what might be new for me. I wasn’t very surprised that I already knew about all the basic functions of Chrome, like bookmarks, the Web Store, and security settings. I had never really given much thought to the ability to switch between multiple users, I am either on a public device where I do not log in to the browser, or I am on my personal device that is used almost exclusively by me. Either way, I am never logging in and out of my browser unless it is logging in for an initial setup of the device. One thing I did learn as something new is about Chrome’s sandboxing technology. I have spent many years being a very surface-level user and have not given much thought to the intricacies of security developments that go on behind the scenes. Understanding what Chrome claims about its security features, I will start paying more attention to the security features and options available across the different browsers I have the opportunity to use.

    <p>For my second activity, I decided to test out a browser I had never considered before: Brave. I installed Brave, and went through nearly everything on their Features page, as well as taking the browser itself for a test run as well. Tracking has never concerned me on a personal level, as my ISP knows more about me than any browser ever will. But any changes that can innately reduce on-screen ads and increase load speed are an absolute win in my book. The more I read about Brave on its Features page, the more intrigued I was by what the browser offered. Search results that didn’t funnel me into results based on what Google already thought it knew about me? Yes, please! And just like in my mobile games, I don’t mind watching an ad to get a reward. But I absolutely hate being interrupted by an ad whose only purpose is to force me to watch it so someone somewhere can get some fraction of a cent while I get nothing but wasted time. So, opting into the BAT Rewards will be something I consider. Also, speaking of ads, I went to a game wiki site that I love for its info, and hate for its load times. In Chrome, the pages jump around for multiple seconds after the page load due to what I assume is poorly imbedded ad spacing. On mobile, my Android browser just hangs for more than 10 seconds on every single page I navigate to. Sometimes I have decided to walk across the house to pull something up on the computer instead of sitting still and waiting for my phone browser to load each time! But on Brave, the pages loaded in an instant and had no jumping around from ads getting incrementally inserted on the page.
