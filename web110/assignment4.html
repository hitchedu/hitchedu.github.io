    <h1>Assignment 4 - Summary</h1>
    <p>The first email activity I did was the tutorial through GCFLearnFree, mostly because I noticed that there was a section about the email calendar. In some ways, I have always used my email calendar for as far back as I can remember. But in other ways, I never realized I was using my email calendar. I always saw it as my Google calendar, which was inherently made available to me on my Android phone. I’ve never used my Windows calendar to do anything more than confirm the date of a specific day, but I just sort of never noticed that my phone’s calendar was available in my computer browser when logged in to my Gmail account until this past year. I fumbled around with the separate calendars at that time, hoping to differentiate my important personal appointments from my Harper due dates and various entertainment and gaming items. I didn’t do that well at it. It kind of worked when looking at it on the PC, but everything felt too hectic trying to view it on my phone, so I abandoned the project. With this tutorial I read today, I am picking back up where I left off by utilizing my calendar to its fullest. And hopefully, I’ll be able to view it on my phone as well without it practically giving me a headache!

    <p>For my second activity, I decided to educate myself more on email spoofing. Spotting a fake email has never been that difficult for me, but I never knew about the Show Original option to analyze the email header. I have a few emails in mind both in my personal Gmail inbox and in my work Outlook that I will be checking in closer detail the next time they come in. Is my Wendy’s account really locked, or are you just trying to get me to feed you some passwords that I probably use across other accounts? We’ll find out!
