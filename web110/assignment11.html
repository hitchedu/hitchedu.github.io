    <h1>Assignment 11 - Summary</h1>
    <p>Other than looking ugly or being difficult to navigate, I had never considered Web Accessibility before this lesson. Wave’s Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool has shown me many of the aspects in which programmers and web designers need to be mindful of how a page is presented, how it is navigated, and how it is coded regarding things that cannot normally be seen on the surface. This led me to update the alt text of the image from Assignment 10, and also made me aware of how websites that I have listened to using a Screen Reader could have been better documented.
      </p>  
    <p>For the second activity, I pitted WebAIM’s Contrast checker against the Paletton site, as well as tested colors on sites I visit regularly. It was interesting to see that some of the sites that I have no problem reading technically failed the Contrast Checker, but after reading the requirements for the Contrast Checker and understanding more about Web Accessibility in general, I can understand why. I have been wanting to update some game wikis (which I hope to get to this summer), and the level of access I would have for one of them would allow me to update the coloring of the pages. While the contrast does mostly pass normally (6.65:1), even I have issues reading the site when Dark Mode is turned on (2.54:1), and this is something I’d like to address at the CSS level.
