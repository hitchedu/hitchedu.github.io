    <h1>Final Project - Summary</h1>
    <p>This class has been a whirlwind tour, moving between things I thought I knew, things I knew I needed to learn more about, and things I knew nothing about ahead of
         time. I thought I didn’t have much to learn about Web Browsers, Search Engines, Email, and Social Media. I was wrong! I knew I had more to learn regarding HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, and I was not disappointed. And then Project Management introduced me to concepts and tools that I never knew existed! I have so many
           bookmarks set aside for continued self-education and reference, and I can’t wait to learn more next semester.
