    <h1>Assignment 7 - Summary</h1>
    <p>I first became aware of password managers back when publicly accessible internet-capable computers at places like my local public library were not always set up to give access to USB ports. Because of this, I could not consider options that required a physical token to be plugged into a USB port. I was also very wary of allowing a manager to generate random passwords for my accounts, since I was worried that I could become locked out of my accounts should the service become inaccessible for a time, or even shut down permanently. As such, I have taken to using two-factor authentication anywhere and everywhere possible, and advise others to do the same. Since I always have my cell phone on me, I normally opt for QR Code scanning or receiving a text message. This does not negate any attempts at maintaining strong passwords, but I simply do not have the memory to utilize truly unique passwords across all of my accounts, especially when choosing to or being forced to update those passwords periodically. I feel like this offers some middle ground while we still do not have ubiquitous access to physical biometric passkeys like fingerprint readers. As advanced as they may be, I would not trust facial or voice recognition to be as strong as fingerprint scanning.

    <p>I tested my firewall using the Gibson Research: ShieldsUP! test, and got the “THE EQUIPMENT AT THE TARGET IP ADDRESS DID NOT RESPOND TO OUR UPnP PROBES! (That's good news!)” response. Though I have to credit this positive outcome wholly to Comcast and their default router/modem settings, I have bookmarked this site to use in the future when expanding my home network to include the home server someday. As convenient as Universal Plug n Play is, it is terrifying to think about from a security viewpoint, so I am very glad that firewalls allow us to continue utilizing UPnP on the private side of our connection while keeping us safe from the public side of that connection at the same time.
