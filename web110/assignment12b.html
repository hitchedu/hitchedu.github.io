    <h1>Assignment 12b - Summary</h1>
    <p>This session could not have come at a better time for me, as I was already trying to update my resume to apply for an internal position at my current employer. The resume tutorial not only helped me hone my current resume for the internal application, but it also gave me ideas for when I will need to eventually create a resume for an external position. As for the LinkedIn Profile portion, I already have an account, and I have been connecting to current coworkers and friends. Beyond that, Iâ€™ve been mostly clueless about the platform. Just being made officially aware of the Navigation and Settings options is helping me be more comfortable on the platform, which is a good step forward from where I was before. And I look forward to utilizing LinkedIn both to communicate with my connections and search for future employment opportunities.
